# AGENTS.md

Read `README.md` and relevant directory-level `README.md` files first for the
project overview and local conventions.

## Working Notes

- Since `uv` is blocked by a read-only cache path in the agent's sandbox,
use a workspace-safe cache directory instead, e.g., `./scripts/agent-env.sh uv <command>` which uses `UV_CACHE_DIR=.cache/uv uv run <command>`.
Tips: `justfile` encapsulates the agent-specific commands, refer to them.
- Do not be constrained by the repository's current dependency set. When a task
reasonably needs a missing dependency, add it autonomously using the project's
dependency-management conventions (basically `uv add`).
- If you identify commands during development that should be documented or
reused, consider adding them to `justfile` with appropriate guidance (for
example, comments).
- Keep documentation complete and in sync throughout development; if you find
gaps, fill them in.
- Always add appropriate comments when working.
